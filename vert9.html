						<p>My first work when I arrived at Radioline was to prototype all the mobile & ablet screens for the Android & iOS radios & podcasts application. Compromises were made regarding to the budget and the time allocated to the developers; that's why unfortunately, we went with the hamburger menu or a static screen player for example.
						As my babies, during my 5 years working at Radioline, one of my main role was to maintain and improve those apps. Having started with Photoshop, I slowly moved to Sketch and then Figma, being able to create and maintain a components library, to prototype the new apps iterations, while using Slack, Redmine or Trello to manage the daily collaboration with the development team from Poland. One of the main difficulty was to communicate to them my vision and the values of the company; maybe right after challenging their estimations. Also, I was the one in charge of testing the builds received, on all our devices, and submitting them to the different platforms (App Store, Google Play, Mi Store etc.) My roadmap was prioritized by business objectives, technical constraints, KPI that I followed on a weekly basis on Analytics, mails fom the support, user reviews, qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys. We developed too a lot of features directly in collaboration with the Apple and the Android teams. Replying to every user on app stores, we kept all those years app stores ratings at more than 4/5 and reached a +1M of app downloads!</p>
